# Beer Out Of Ten

### Running the dev server
- When in base directory, to install all dependencies run:
```bash
npm run install:all
```
- To run the full stack, run:
```bash
npm run dev:full
```
- To run the front end only, run:
```bash
npm run dev:front
```
- To run the back end only, run:
```bash
npm run dev:back
```

You can also run the front end and back end separately by navigating to the respective directories and running specific npm commands in each. These scripts are located in the package.json files in the respective directories.
